# PR-Issue-Scraper

PR-Issue-Scraper extracts explicit PRIssue links using GitHub GraphQL API.
We design our tool to deal with the GraphQL request limitation; hence GitHub GraphQL API rate limit is 5,000 points per hour
. We ran PR-Issue-Scraperto target all Android repositories on GitHub in the time period between the 1st of January 2011 to the 1st of January 2021.
The run takes around 30 days (24/7) to archive our target.
